This software is designed to help with furnishing UGC creation for MapleStory2.

# Warning:
This is a very alpha project.
The deadline was too short (1 week) and this is my first Qt Quick project.

For now this is intended to be a small and, hopefully, an useful tool for a limited time event.

In case the game event is extended and/or rehearsed I'll refactor most of it and continue to maintain the project.
