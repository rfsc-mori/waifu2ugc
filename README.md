Warning:
This is a very alpha project.
The deadline was too short (1 week) and this is my first Qt Quick project.

This software is designed to help with furnishing UGC creation for MapleStory2.

For now this is intended to be a small and, hopefully, an useful tool for a limited time event.

In case the game event is extended and/or rehearsed I'll continue to maintain the project.
